# CONDENSED : CONvert Diffs to fakE vim sessioNs for aSciinema rEcorDing

based on [this lovely, simple cli editor](https://github.com/tdryer/editor), we
take in a diff, figure out which file it edits, and then send a series of
keypresses which make it look like we're typing interactively.

Perfect for Asciinema recordings where you want to show every step you're going
to do on the CLI, without having to have a human do it.
